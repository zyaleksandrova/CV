        <p class= "intro-1">I am Zlatina, but you can call me Tina. I am a marketing professional, passionate about <span style="color:#0080ff">smart marketing, creative content, and effective communication</span> to make it all happen. In my work, I have seen the value of applying the creative process and utilizing the latest digital technologies to gain the most suitable outcomes for the stakeholder‚Äôs needs.</p>
        <p class="intro-2">Personally, I strive to always approach challenges with <span style="color:#0080ff">a positive mindset and a critical eye</span>. Unleashing curiosity and encouraging critical thinking has proven to be beneficial to increasing customer engagement and lead generation in previous marketing projects and campaigns I have worked on.
        My past work and study experiences have helped me become highly adaptable to different environments and cultures, which in turn has made me a better collaborator.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a (sometimes) funny extrovert, I love traveling, meeting new people, and enjoying life. üòä

        <h3>Marketing Associate</h3>
        <p class="G2">I can't be happier to have started my career with the amazing people working at G2 Tech Group (now a part of Mission). This experience enhanced my digital marketing skills through daily technical content creation and SEO optimization. Thanks to the lean culture of the company, I was able to work closely with the executive team and learn by doing, observing, and reflecting. As a result, I rapidly adapted myself to the organizational structure and gained the respect of my supervisors and coworkers.</p>
